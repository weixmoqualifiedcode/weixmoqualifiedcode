 Some colleges and universities offer forms of emergency aid other than loans. These grants are similar to emergency student loans in that they’re meant to help cover unexpected financial hardships. However, unlike loans, grants don’t have to be repaid.

In fact, because grants are essentially free money that you won’t have to repay, it may be worth looking into your school’s emergency grant offerings before applying for an emergency loan.
