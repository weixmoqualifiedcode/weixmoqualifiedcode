Many borrowers turn to the federal government or private lenders for their student loans. But emergency student loans are typically offered by colleges and universities and are only available to students enrolled at that institution.

While the terms of these loans depend on your school, most are short-term loans that must be repaid in about 30 to 90 days. Additionally, loan amounts are often limited to around $500.

What Is an Emergency Student Loan?

Unlike other student loans, emergency student loans are not intended for tuition and other school expenses. Theyâ€™re available to students experiencing a financial emergency or setback, such as a death in the family, a natural disaster, unemployment, or another similar circumstances.
